I want to get stuff from the database.
So I have "\\vmware-host\Shared Folders\C\kingdom-rush". Inside this, I want to generate folders. First, we create folders for games. We do this by quering the database and getting the values from Kingdom_Rush.game's. So we create those folders. Then inside each folder we create a folder for each stage in that game. Each stage has the game stored. Then inside each stage folder we will generate a folder for play mode. Then inside the play mode folder, say Kingdom Rush Pagras Campaign, we will create folders for each difficulty. For Kingdom Rush and Kingdom Rush Frontiers (KRF) we will create casual, normal, veteran. For Kingdom Rush Origins (KRO), Kingdom Rush Vengeance (KRV), and Kingdom Rush 5 (KR5), we will create casual, normal, veteran, impossible.
Write C# to do this.
